# Yodish Translator

Convert from English to Yoda speak. This language is spoken by the "Yoda's Species" in Star Wars Series. Have fun and may the force be with you!

## What is Yodish?

Yoda often orders sentences as Object-Subject-Verb, split verbs, switches entire phrases and sometimes uses sentences that are different from his normal syntax!
This is how Yodish looks and sounds like:

> "Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hmm? Hmm. And well you should not. For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes. Even between the land and the ship."                     
>-Yoda, to Luke Skywalker
